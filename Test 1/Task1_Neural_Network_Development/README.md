# Task 1: Neural Network Development

### Description
This folder contains a Python script (`neural_network_mnist.py`) that implements a simple neural network using TensorFlow to classify images from the MNIST dataset. The script trains the model and evaluates its performance using accuracy and loss metrics.

### Usage
1. Install TensorFlow or any required dependencies.
2. Run `neural_network_mnist.py`.
3. Follow the instructions in the script to adjust parameters if needed.

### Important Details
- Ensure you have the MNIST dataset available or adjust the data loading part of the script.
- Explanation of the code and parameters chosen is provided within the script comments.
