# Task 2: Working with Databases

### Description
This folder contains Python scripts (`database.py`) demonstrating interaction with SQL. It performs CRUD operations and showcases database interactions.

### Explanation for using SQLite:

SQLite is used as it's lightweight, serverless, and suitable for small-scale applications.
A table 'users' is created with columns for id (primary key), name, and email.
CRUD operations are performed: Insertion, Retrieval, Update, and Deletion.

### Explanation for Database Structure Choice:

For the SQL (SQLite) database,
a relational structure with tables and columns was chosen because the data has a clear structure (name and email).

### Usage
1. Install necessary database libraries (e.g., `sqlite3`).
2. Run the respective scripts (`sql_database_script.py` for SQL).
3. Modify scripts according to your database setup and requirements.

### Important Details
- Ensure database connectivity and adjust credentials if needed in the scripts.
- Explanation of database structure and code functionality is provided within the scripts.
