# Task 3: Integration with Google API

### Description
1. This folder contains a Python script (`google_api.py`) that interacts with the Google Sheets API. It fetches data from a Google Spreadsheet, performs operations, and demonstrates CRUD functionality.
2. This folder contains a json file (`credentials.json`) that is used for the implementation of further steps.
3. This folder contains a google sheet (`demo.xlsx`) which was used in the google drive and in further implementations.
   
### Usage
1. Obtain `credentials.json` from the Google Developer Console for API access.
2. Install necessary libraries (e.g., `gspread`, `oauth2client`).
3. Run `google_api.py`.
4. Modify the script to use your spreadsheet ID and adjust operations as needed.

### Important Details
- Ensure proper authentication with Google API and access to the spreadsheet.
- Explanation of code functionality and handling future deprecation warnings is provided in the script.
